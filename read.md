Hey everyone! I have created one of the needed project today that is Youtube videos downloader. Here one can download there needed video from youtube. You simply need to give video link as input and and you will get video name and it will be downloaded in your device. In this project I have used the pytube module, imported YouTube and created the list of all stream from which you can select and download as per your need.
